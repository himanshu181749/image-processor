### Project Overview

This document outlines the submission for my Image Processing System project, designed to process image data from CSV files, shrink images to 50% quality, store results in a database, and provide APIs for tracking progress. The project meets all assignment requirements and includes bonus features like webhook notifications. Below are the key components and links for review.

   - **Purpose**: A flowchart illustrating the system‚Äôs architecture and data flow, created using Draw.io.
   - **Details**:
     - Shows the user, APIs, database, image processing, output folder, and webhook interactions.
     - Clear arrows and labels for a professional presentation.

5. **API Documentation**

   - **Location**: Included in the GitHub repository as part of `README.md`.
   - **Purpose**: Clear specifications for the `POST /api/upload` and `GET /api/status/:requestId` endpoints.
